To select any other module, you need to navigate the modules graph manually, step by step.\n\nKeep in mind that a standalone application does not have any network listeners, so any Nest features related to HTTP (e.g., middleware, interceptors, pipes, guards, etc.) are not available in this context.\n\nFor example, even if you register a global interceptor in your application and then retrieve a controller's instance using the app.get() method, the interceptor will not be executed.\n\nRetrieving providers from dynamic modules\nWhen dealing with dynamic modules, we should supply the same object that represents the registered dynamic module in the application to app.select. For example:\n```\ntype:typescript\n@@filename()\nexport const dynamicConfigModule = ConfigModule.register({ folder: './config' });\n@Module({\n  imports: [dynamicConfigModule],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n\nThen you can select that module later on:\ntypescript\n@@filename()\nconst configService = app.select(dynamicConfigModule).get(ConfigService, { strict: true });\n\nTerminating phase\nIf you want the Node application to close after the script finishes (e.g., for a script running CRON jobs), you must call the app.close() method in the end of your bootstrap function like this:\n```\n**Label1** (or alternative label if needed)\n\nThis classification can be used as a starting point for training a machine learning model to categorize Node.js-related text.

A working example is available here.\n**Tagged:** Example, Link\n\n4. Libraries\n**Tagged:** Chapter, NestJS\n\n5. Many applications need to solve the same general problems, or re-use a modular component in several different contexts. Nest has a few ways of addressing this, but each works at a different level to solve the problem in a way that helps meet different architectural and organizational objectives.\n**Tagged:** Definition, NestJS\n\n6. Nest modules are useful for providing an execution context that enables sharing components within a single application. Modules can also be packaged with npm to create a reusable library that can be installed in different projects. This can be an effective way to distribute configurable, re-usable libraries that can be used by different, loosely connected or unaffiliated organizations (e.g., by distributing/installing 3rd party libraries).\n**Tagged:** Definition, Nest Modules\n\n7. For sharing code within closely organized groups (e.g., within company/project boundaries), it can be useful to have a more lightweight approach to sharing components. Monorepos have arisen as a construct to enable that, and within a monorepo, a library provides a way to share code in an easy, lightweight fashion. In a Nest monorepo, using libraries enables easy assembly of applications that share components. In fact, this encourages decomposition of monolithic applications and development processes to focus on building and composing modular components.\n**Tagged:** Definition, Monorepos\n\n8. Nest libraries\n**Tagged:** Chapter, NestJS\n\n9. A Nest library is a Nest project that differs from an application in that it cannot run on its own. A library must be imported into a containing application in order for its code to execute. The built-in support for libraries described in this section is only available for monorepos (standard mode projects can achieve similar functionality using npm packages).\n**Tagged:** Definition, Nest Libraries\n\n10. For example, an organization may develop an AuthModule that manages authentication by implementing company policies that govern all internal applications. Rather than build that module separately for each application, or physically packaging the code with npm and requiring each project to install it, a monorepo can define this module as a library. When organized this way, all consumers of the library module can see an up-to-date version of the AuthModule as it is committed. This can have significant benefits for coordinating component development and assembly, and simplifying end-to-end testing.\n**Tagged:** Example, Monorepos\n\n11. Creating libraries\n**Tagged:** Chapter, NestJS\n\n**Note:** The tags are manually assigned based on the content of each text snippet."
